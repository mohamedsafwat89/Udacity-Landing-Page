## Instructions

First project with Udacity . It's about converting this project from a static project to an interactive one.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality.
I prefer to Run this project on google chrome

## Methods

I used :
  Element.scrollIntoView() To make scroll smooth and dynamic 
  
  Event.preventDefault()
